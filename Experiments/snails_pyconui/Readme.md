pyconui (Python Console User Interface) is a module created by SleepingSnail, mostly for his own use, that allows the creation of console "UIs", sort of anyways.
It reads text files that tell it how the UI should look. It supports slots with specified length, colors, and maybe some other stuff.

Hopefully this project will be completed soon enough, because it is NOT ready right now.
